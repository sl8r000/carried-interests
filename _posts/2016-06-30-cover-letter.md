Hello,

Let me tell you about myself, and why I'm the perfect data engineer for startuply.io. When it comes to managing large data flows, my motto has always been to **do things that don't scale**. As a result of following this motto uncompromisingly, I have an extensive track record of **failing fast**. And the consequences I achieve aren't limited to the technical layer, they the overall business strategy: Each of my previous employers has made a total **pivot** after seeing the results of my actions.

I'm a full stack developer, so I also have experience in designing higher level applications. I'm proud to say that whenever I build a new product, my coworkers have been quick to call it "**minimally viable**".

At startuply.io, I'll relentlessly pursue the same results I've achieved elsewhere in the past. I guarantee that, once hired, I'll **move fast and break things** all throughout your organization! I'm confident that because of my actions, startuply.io will experience massive **disruption**.

Cheers,

X
