Hello,

Let me tell you about myself, and why I'm the perfect data engineer for startuply.io. When it comes to managing large data flows, my motto has always been to **do things that don't scale** and as a result, I'm proud to say that I have an extensive record of **failing fast**. Whenever I build a new product, coworkers and customers alike are quick to call it "**minimally viable**". Once hired, I'll **move fast and break things** throughout your organization, which I guarantee will result in massive **disruption** for your business.

Cheers, X
