title: Silicon Valley Cover Letter

Hello,

Let me tell you about myself, and why I'm the perfect data engineer for startuply.io. When it comes to managing large data flows, my motto has always been to **do things that don't scale**. As a result, I have an extensive track record of **failing fast**. And I'm proud to say that every product I've helped build has been described as "**minimally viable**". Once I'm hired at startup.ly, I'll **move fast and break things** all throughout your organization. I'm confident that this will achieve massive **disrupution** for your company.

Cheers,

X
