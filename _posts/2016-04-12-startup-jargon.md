title: Startup Jargon

Dear CEO,

Thanks for interviewing me at startuply.io! Throughout my career as a database administrator, my motto has always been: **Do things that don't scale**. As a result, I have a proven track record of **failing fast**, and am proud to say that my coworkers routinely describe my work as "**minimally viable**". I'm confident that at your company, my ability to **move fast and break things** will result in massive **disruption** throughout your entire organization.

Cheers,

Hack R.
