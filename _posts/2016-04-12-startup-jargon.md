Hello,

Let me tell you about myself, and why I'm the perfect database administrator for startuply.io. As a DBA, my motto has always been to **do things that don't scale**. Perhaps becaues of this, I have a proven track record of **failing fast** (some say the fastest they've ever seen someone fail). And I'm proud to say that every product I've helped build has been described as "**minimally viable**". Once I'm hired at startup.ly, I'll **move fast and break things** all throughout your organization. I'm confident that this will achieve massive **disrupution** for your company.

Cheers,
X
