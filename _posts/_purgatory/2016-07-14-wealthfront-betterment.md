title: Betterment at $5b
---

A couple days ago, Betterment announced that it reached $5b in AUM. I don't use either product, but I think that Betterment and Wealthfront provide a useful service, so: congrats! Still, whenever I hear an AUM figure for one of the companies, I can't help but think about their revenue, which shows why the low-fee model has constraints that, in turn, require either huge growth or other sources of revenue.

Betterment charges between 35 and 15 basis points in annual management fees (though: stay tuned); Wealthfront charges between 0 and 25 basis points. It's hard to make money off such a small commission.

To see this, let's take the optimistic/upper-bound figure, and imagine that Betterment earns the full 35 bps on all $5m of AUM. At 35 bps, their growth profit is $17.5m. There's no way that this even comes close to covering operating costs; Betterment has about 150 employees in Manhattan and I'd (conservatively) guess that their cost per employee is at least $150k, so employment costs alone total $22.5m or more.

Growth could solve this problem, if it leads to huge AUM. To reach $100m in ARR, Betterment would need at least $26.6b in AUM; if their blended fees were closer to 25 bps (like Wealthfront), they'd need $40b. Is this kind of growth possible and, if so, how long will it take? Here's growth to date for Betterment (thanks to [Bill Winterberg](http://fppad.com/2015/08/16/wealthfront-and-betterment-aum-growth-chart/) for the data):

The kind of growth needed is not impossible. Here's that Vanguard, the OG low-fee passive-investing service, AUM has looked like over time:

And, as Wealthfront has pointed out, the chart for Charles Schwab shows great growth over time:

To believe the profitability-through-growth plan, what you have to believe is that Wealthfront and Betterment will be able to quickly grow AUM in an LTV-efficient way. Less guardedly, I think that what you really need to believe is that Betterment & Wealthfront will grow exponentially, not linearly. And they might! Schwab and Vanguard did.

# Small Account Monetization

Aside from growth, another way to increase revenue is, of course, to charge more. This is a bit difficult for Betterment and Welathfront to do, since their brands are built on the idea of a low-fee alternative to traditional financial advisors. Still, some have argued that Betterment is already going this route. A while ago, Wealthfront CEO Adam Nash [criticized  Betterment](https://medium.com/@adamnash/it-s-time-to-kill-the-monthly-fee-for-small-accounts-51d37177bfe7#.xwtpu7nff) for its monthly fees. As of this writing, the way that Betterment's fees work for small accounts is:

* If your account balance is more than $10k, you pay 25 bps or less.
* If your account balance is less than $10k, then:
    1. If you auto-deposit $100 or more each month, you pay 35 bps
    2. If you auto-deposit less than $100 per month (or don't auto-deposit at all), you pay $3 per month.

As Nash points out, this is regressive pricing that that can be expensive for small accounts. A $500 account with no auto-deposit, for example, would pay $36 in its first year, or 720 bps(!) of fees.

Nash claims that roughly 1/3 of Betterment's revenue comes from this $3-a-month pricing. So how does this change total revenue? I don't have the source of truth, but we can again make an upper bound. We can upper bound percentage-based fees at 0.35x$5b = $17.5m, as before. And assuming the $3-a-month pricing is purely additive, we get another $8.75m in fees. So in total, we're talking about $26.25m in fees as an upper bound.

If you mix this, Betterment's making 52.5 bps or less on its AUM right now. So it would need about $19b to hit a $100m revenue run rate.

Betterment CEO Jon Stein responded to Nash's criticism with his [own article](https://medium.com/@jonstein/betterment-sets-the-record-straight-d66deb96fad2#.3g3zbi8x3). The main data point to the above is that Stein claims that 10%, not 1/3, of Betterment's revenue comes from the $3-a-month fee. Under that number and the same assumptions as above, total revenue should be closer to $19.5m and the blended fees closer to 39bps. So Betterment would need about $25.6b in AUM to reach $100m ARR. It's also fair/important to point out that Betterment is cheaper for customers with at least $100k deposited, charging 15 bps a year rather than Wealthfront's 25 bps; that's at least a $100 difference per year.
