title: "MoM to IRR Mental Math"
---

If you exit an investment with a 4x return in 6 years, what's your IRR? It's about 26%, and with practice you can get to that answer with mental math in under 10 seconds. I'll describe the algorithm first, then explain where it comes from.

## The Algorithm

1. Start with your MoM, which is 4.0 in the above example. Look it up in the following table:

| MoM | Log |
|----:|----:|
| 2x | 0.7 |
| 3x | 1.1 |
| 4x | 1.4 |
| 5x | 1.6 |
