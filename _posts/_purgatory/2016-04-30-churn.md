# Measurement

Does your company know how many users churned last month? Or what fraction of the May 2015 cohort is still around? These are basic questions, but you'd be surprised at how often this foundational data is unknown. I've even been asked to build predictive models for churn in situations where no one knew what the churn rate was (even roughly). The point is that before you do anything else, you need to get your basic analytics set; often, this step alone reveals enough to cover its cost 10x.

The best way to understand churn metrics is by cohort. Make a table that looks like this:

<!-- Insert Table -->

This data gives you the first thing you should put in your dashboard, report, or whatever: The waterfall table for survival rates:

<!-- Insert Table -->

This table lets you see what fraction of users remain from each cohort after a number of months. For example, <!-- Example -->. Why is this useful? It lets you predict retention rate into the future, and it lets you see if something went "wrong" such that one cohort has significantly worse churn than others. This is particularly useful when segemented by acquisition channel. Does the January 2005 cohort of YouTube-ad-acquired users have abnormally high churn? Maybe the ad got lot of clicks from uninterested or unqualified users.
