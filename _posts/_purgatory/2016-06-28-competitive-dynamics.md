VCs worry a lot about market defensibility when considering an investment. In looking at Company X, they want to know to what extent Company X will be able to defend the profitability and market share that it will, hopefully, attain in the future.

Can Uber avoid being undercut by competitors who are willing to be less profitable or to restrict themselves to dominating local markets? Are the switching costs so high that consumers won't move from Dropbox to another file sharing company? Etc.

In the context of early-stage venture investing, I doubt this worry is worthwile. Investing in companies that have defensible market positions makes sense as a goal, but it probably isn't a practical concern for early-stage deals because of the difficulty in prediction. I'm not saying that defensibility isn't important; it obviously is. But predicting Company X's defensibility at the A or B round is so hard that it's likely pointless to try. It matters, but you can't predict it.

Part of the bias here probably comes from hindsight since, again, successful companies usually attain strong defensibility, so it's tempting to look backwards in time and think that path to defensibility was prectiable. It's easy for strategy textbooks to say, in 2016, here's how
