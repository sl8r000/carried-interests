title: How to LBO a Gas Station
---

Not that you'd necessarily want to. But it's an interesting look into the business behind gas stations, which is more complex than I would have guessed.

# Business Model

Gas stations earn revenue by selling gas and, surprisingly importantly, convenience store items. Let's look at the gas right now, and come back to the convenience store later.

Gas stations are either branded or independent. Branded stations -- like the Shell, Valero, etc. stations you see every day -- typically sign a long term contract to get gas from a [major fuel supplier](http://www.kendrickoil.com/the-differences-between-branded-vs-unbranded-fuel/), and to carry the supplier's brand. Independent stations buy gasoline on the unbranded wholesale market, usually from a distributor ([e.g.](http://www.petroleumtraders.com/unbranded-retail.aspx)) who also arranges delivery. 

Based on aggregating prospectuses I gathered from brokerages for independent (non-branded) gas stations, **the self-reported gross margins on a gallon of gas can range from $0.07 to $0.30.** Volume varies even more. A station might retail less than 15,000 gallons or more than 150,000 gallons per month. As you would guess, location plays a dominant role in determining both volume and margin. If you spend time on formus for gas station investors, you'll see a lot of folk theories about ideal location selection. (For example: Some people suggest being the "first" gas station on the way into a town, or between a city and its suburbs. Others suggest locating far away from retailers like Sam's Club that sell gas cheaply to get people in their store.)

Now let's come back to the convenience store. For all the stations I looked at, **sales from concessions usually generated much more gross profit than did gas**. That's because gross margins are closer to 30% here. Lotto tickets are also a big revenue item for most gas stations; these typically carry a 5% commission (so selling $100 of lotto tickets earns $5 for the station), and should be considered separately.

Those are the main sources of revenue. Now let's look at costs. Besides already accounted CoGS, the major costs are:

* **Payroll**: A small independent station will have one FTE minimum-wage employee, on an 18 or 24 hour day.
* **Rent**: Most stations don't own the land they're on, and the convenience store building (and even the pumps and other PP&E) is often leased too.
* **Utilities**: The usual electricity and water bills.
* **Insurance**: Aside from the usual general liability, workers comp, etc., you'll also need a policy that pays out if your tanks cause any environmental damage. (Though, c.f. [LUST funds](https://www.epa.gov/ust/leaking-underground-storage-tank-lust-trust-fund).)
* **Credit Card Processing Fees**. These will run around 2%.

(By the way, think about how much a ~2% credit card processing fee is if the gross profit per gallon is only $0.15. For a $3.00 gallon of gass, it's 6/15 = 40%. This partially explains those gas credit cards you see, or gas stations that accept cash/debit tender types only. From my time in payments, I also wonder if now that gas stations are  [are allowed](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/credit-cards/credit-card-charged-more-gas-station/) to pass credit card processing fees on to the consumer, we may see this become less of an expense for stations in the future.)

# Financing

If we're going to do an LBO, we'd better get some debt. **As a major disclaimer: I've never actually tried to get a loan to buy a gas station.** From what I can tell, though, it looks like there are two main financing options:

1. Get an SBA loan from a bank, or
2. Get a conventional loan (also from a bank).

SBA loans are regulated and partially guaranteed by the federal government; this makes them the better choice (assuming you can get approval) due to their lower interest rates and higher allowable leverage ratios. To figure out how much debt we can service, let's get a back of the envelope free cash flow. For specificity, let's take a station that looks like this:


| Operations         |                                             |             |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------:|
| Revenue            |                                             |             |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------|
|                    | Gas revenue (50,000 gallons @ $3.00/gallon) | $150,000.00 |
|                    | Convenience store revenue                   | $70,000.00  |
|                    | Lotto revenue                               | $100,000.00 |
|                    | Total                                       | $320,000.00 |
| Cost of revenue    |                                             |             |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------|
|                    | Gas                                         | $142,500.00 |
|                    | Convenience store                           | $49,000.00  |
|                    | Lotto                                       | $95,000.00  |
|                    | Total                                       | $286,500.00 |
|                    | Gross Profit                                | $33,500.00  |
| Operating expenses |                                             |             |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------|
|                    | Payroll                                     | $5,000.00   |
|                    | Rent                                        | $10,000.00  |
|                    | Utilities                                   | $3,000.00   |
|                    | Insurance                                   | $1,500.00   |
|                    | Credit card fees                            | $3,000.00   |
|                    | Total                                       | $22,500.00  |
|                    | Operating Income                            | $11,000.00  |

So we have about $132k of annual operating income to play this. The gas stations I looked at trade around 2x to 3x annual operating income, so this station will cost around $396k on the high side. (This is for the business only; we're not buying the real estate.) The SBA loans I looked at advertised allowable leverage around 65% of purchase price, and our interest rate is no higher than 5.75% (by law); let's say we can get 5% because we're such a great lendee.  With flat operating income, the same ($396k) exit price, and no principal repayment until exit, our story looks like this after five years (when we sell):

|    | Year 1                    | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
|---------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Earnings before interest  | 132000 | 132000 | 132000 | 132000 | 132000 |
| Interest expense          | 12870  | 12870  | 12870  | 12870  | 12870  |
| Free cash flow            | 119130 | 119130 | 119130 | 119130 | 119130 |
| Cumulative free cash flow | 119130 | 238260 | 357390 | 476520 | 595650 |

So in the end, we put up $138,600 of our own capital (35% of $396,000), and five years later, we pulled out about $208,500. That's about an 8.5% annual rate of return which is pretty poor. We need a way to either get a better deal or make the station more profitable. That's where the add part of the LBO comes in.

# Improving Profitability?

To me, the numbers indicate that it's pretty hard to make money selling gas; deaggregated, the convenience store has much higher net income than the pump. Obviously, if you can raise prices on gas (maybe by having a local monopoly), that part of the business might look better; but for most stations, concessions are where the money comes from. So how do you make more money there so that your five year returns are better?

One thing that stood out to me was how much revenue comes from lotto tickets, making it natural to ask if we can sell more. One idea is to make it easier, faster, and more convenient to buy lotto tickets by placing lotto vending machines right next to the pumps:

![machine](http://static.www.calottery.com/~/media/Lucky-Retailers/more-ways-to-buy/16-bin_VM_Scratchers_vending_machine.jpg)

These machines are interesting on their own. To buy a ticket, you first swipe your driver's license to verify that you're old enough to play. Then you buy your ticket (in cash, for the particular machine pictured). 

As I was looking into lotto vending machines, I found that somebody at the California State Lottery has already thought of the gas station tie-in: in Sacramento and parts of Los Angeles, you can already "play at the pump".

![play at pump](http://static.www.calottery.com/~/media/Happenings/promos/Play%20at%20the%20Pump/pump-white-background-smaller.jpg)

So to complete the thought, let's say that we can increase lotto sales for our gas station by 50%. That gives us an extra $30,000 of operating income per year, which increases our rate of return from 8.5% to about 21%. Which is not bad, if we can pull it off.

# Parting Shots

What do you think? Are there better ways to improve gas station profitability? And if you own a gas station, I'd love to hear from you to find out what I got wrong, and what your experience says is effective in running a station.
