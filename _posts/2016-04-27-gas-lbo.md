title: How to LBO a Gas Station
---

Not that you'd necessarily want to. But it's surprisingly interesting to learn how gas stations work and how to buy one.

# Business Model

Gas stations earn revenue by selling gas and convenience store items. The convenience store is important, and we'll come back to that later; for now, let's focus on the gas.

Independent stations buy gasoline on the unbranded wholesale market, usually from a distributor ([e.g.](http://www.petroleumtraders.com/unbranded-retail.aspx)) who also arranges delivery. The station then stores the gas in huge (8,000 to 10,000 gallon) underground tanks below the pumps. If you've been to a gas station and seen covers like this:

What lies underneath is this:

These tanks have a huge environmental liability that you'll want to insure against aggressively.

Based on aggregating prospectuses I gathered from gas station brokerages, **the self-reported gross margins on a gallon of gas can range from $0.07 to $0.30.** Volume varies even more. A station might retail less than 15,000 gallons or more than 150,000 gallons per month. As you would guess, location plays a dominant role in determining both volume and margin.

Now let's look the convenience store. For all the stations I looked at, **sales from concessions generated more gross profit than did gas**. That's because gross margins are closer to 30% here.

Besides already accounted CoGS, the major costs are:

* **Payroll**: A small independent station will have one FTE minimum-wage employee, on an 18 or 24 hour day.
* **Rent**: Most stations don't own the land they're on, and the PP&E is often leased too.
* **Utilities**: As expected.
* **Insurance**: Aside from the usual general liability, workers comp, etc., you'll also need a policy that pays out if your tanks cause any environmental damage. (C.f. [LUST funds](https://www.epa.gov/ust/leaking-underground-storage-tank-lust-trust-fund))
* **Credit Card Processing Fees**.

(By the way, think about how much a ~2% credit card processing fee is if the gross profit per gallon is only $0.15. For a $3.00 gallon of gass, it's 6/15 = 40%. This partially explains those gas credit cards you see, or gas stations that accept cash/debit tender types only.)

# Financing

**Disclaimer: I've never actually done this.** It looks like there are two main financing options:

1. Get an SBA loan, or
2. Get a conventional bank loan.

SBA loans are regulated and partially guaranteed by the federal government; this makes them the better choice (assuming you can get approval) due to their lower interest rates and higher allowable leverage ratios.

Let's imagine a gas station whose monthly income looks like this:


| Operations         |                                             |             |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------:|
| Revenue            |                                             |             |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------|
|                    | Gas revenue (50,000 gallons @ $3.00/gallon) | $150,000.00 |
|                    | Convenience store revenue                   | $70,000.00  |
|                    | Lotto revenue                               | $100,000.00 |
|                    | Total                                       | $320,000.00 |
| Cost of revenue    |                                             |             |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------|
|                    | Gas                                         | $142,500.00 |
|                    | Convenience store                           | $49,000.00  |
|                    | Lotto                                       | $95,000.00  |
|                    | Total                                       | $286,500.00 |
|                    | Gross Profit                                | $33,500.00  |
| Operating expenses |                                             |             |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------|
|                    | Payroll                                     | $5,000.00   |
|                    | Rent                                        | $10,000.00  |
|                    | Utilities                                   | $3,000.00   |
|                    | Insurance                                   | $1,500.00   |
|                    | Credit card fees                            | $3,000.00   |
|                    | Total                                       | $22,500.00  |
|                    | Operating Income                            | $11,000.00  |

Let's say that gas stations trade around 2x annual operating income, so this station will cost around $264k. This is for the business only; we're not buying the real estate. Let's say that our leverage is 65% of purchase price, and our interest rate is 6.5%. With flat operating income, the same ($264k) exit price, and no principal repayment until exit:

|                           | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
|---------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Earnings before interest  | 11,000 | 11,000 | 11,000 | 11,000 | 11,000 |
| Interest expense          | 10296  | 10296  | 10296  | 10296  | 10296  |
| Free cash flow            | 704    | 704    | 704    | 704    | 704    |
| Cumulative free cash flow | 704    | 1,408  | 2,112  | 2,816  | 3,520  |

So in the end, we put up $92,400 of our own capital (35% of $264,000), and five years later, we made $3,520 or 0.52% annualized interest. Hey, I never said this was a good idea. But maybe we can make more money somehow...

# Improving Profitability?

To me, the numbers indicate that it's pretty hard to make money selling gas; deaggregated, the convenience store has much higher net income than the pump. Obviously, if you can raise prices on gas (maybe by having a local monopoly), that part of the business might look better; but for most stations, concessions are where the money comes from. So how do you make more money there so that your five year returns are better?

One thing that stood out to me was how much revenue comes from lotto tickets, making it natural to ask: Can we sell more? One idea is to bring sales closer to the pump with a lotto vending machine:

These machines are interesting on their own. Buyers swipe a driver's license to verify they're old enough to play, and then they buy tickets with cash. This setup has the further advantage of not requiring an in-person transaction to take place. And in fact, somebody has already thought of the gas station tie-in: in Sacramento and parts of Los Angeles, you can already "play at the pump".

Another idea is to target "Well, I'm already here" sales in the convenience store. Maybe have an
