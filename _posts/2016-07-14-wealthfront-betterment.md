# Can Wealthfront and Betterment Make Money?

A couple days ago, Betterment announced that it reached $5b in AUM. I love the service that Wealthfront and Betterment provide, so: congrats! Still, whenever I hear an AUM figure for one of the companies, I can't help but think about thier gross profit, which seems to suggest a difficult road for the business model.

Betterment charges between 35 and 15 basis points in annual management fees; Wealthfront charges between 0 and 25 basis points. Let's take the most optimistic figure possible, and imagine that Betterment earns the full 35 bps on all $5m of AUM. (More realistically, I'd bet their real blended fee is much closer to 15 bps, even before accounting for the refer-a-friend promotional rates.) At 35 bps, their growth profit is $17.5m. There's no way that this even comes close to covering operating costs; Bettermen has about 150 employees in Manhattan and their cost per employee is at least $150k, so employment costs alone total $22.5m or more.

### Could Betterment become profitable on its current business model?

Sure, with huge AUM. To reach $100m in gross, Betterment would need at least $26.6b in AUM; if their blended fees were closer to 25 bps, they'd need $40b. It could happen, but that seems a long way off. Results to date:

Betterment has been advertising more recently and spending more on customer acquisition in other ways. I don't have this data, but I'd love to see their LTV/CAC expressed as the amount of AUM they generate per dollar of spend. At 25bps, they'd need about $400 of AUM per dollar of spend to break even on a gross basis.

### Could Betterment raise fees?

I think they'll have a hard time since:

1. The basic product (asset allocation via ETFs) is easily reproducible. And it's not hard or painful for customers to switch services.
2. The entire brand is built around having low fees relative to traditional financial planners.
