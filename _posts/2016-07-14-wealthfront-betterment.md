# Can Wealthfront and Betterment Make Money?

A couple days ago, Betterment announced that it reached $5b in AUM. I don't use either product, but I think that Betterment and Wealthfront provide a useful service for many people, so: congrats! Still, whenever I hear an AUM figure for one of the companies, I can't help but think about their revenue, which seems to suggest a difficult road for the business model.

Betterment charges between 35 and 15 basis points in annual management fees (though: stay tuned); Wealthfront charges between 0 and 25 basis points. It's hard to make money off such a small commission.

To see this, let's take the most optimistic figure possible, and imagine that Betterment earns the full 35 bps on all $5m of AUM. At 35 bps, their growth profit is $17.5m. There's no way that this even comes close to covering operating costs; Bettermen has about 150 employees in Manhattan and their cost per employee is at least $150k, so employment costs alone total $22.5m or more.

Can growth solve this problem? Sure, with huge AUM. To reach $100m in ARR, Betterment would need at least $26.6b in AUM; if their blended fees were closer to 25 bps (like Wealthfront), they'd need $40b. It could happen, but that seems a long way off. Results to date:

Betterment has been advertising more recently and spending more on customer acquisition in other ways. I don't have this data, but I'd love to see their LTV/CAC expressed as the amount of AUM they generate per dollar of spend. At 25bps, they'd need about $400 of AUM per dollar of spend to break even on a gross basis.

# Small Account Monetization

A while ago, Wealthfront CEO Adam Nash [called out Betterment](https://medium.com/@adamnash/it-s-time-to-kill-the-monthly-fee-for-small-accounts-51d37177bfe7#.xwtpu7nff) for its monthly fees. As of this writing, the way that Betterment's fees work for small accounts is:

* If your account balance is more than $10k, you pay 25 bps or less.
* If your account balance is less than $10k, then:
    1. If you auto-deposit $100 or more each month, you pay 35 bps
    2. If you auto-deposit less than $100 per month (or don't auto-deposit at all), you pay $3 per month.

As Nash points out, this is regressive pricing that that can be pricy for small accounts. A $500 account with no auto-deposit, for example, would pay $36 in its first year, or 720 bps(!).

So, interestingly, Betterment stands to make more revenue from smaller accounts. (A $10k account generates $35 in fees while a $500 account generates slightly more ($36), despite being 20x smaller.) Is it possible to make money this way?

Nash claims that roughly 1/3 of Betterment's revenue comes from this $3-a-month pricing. We can upper bound the "normal", percentage-based fees at 0.35x$5b = $17.5m, as before. And assuming the $3-a-month pricing is purely additive (again, this is an upper bound), we get another $8.75m in fees. So in total, we're talking about $26.25m in fees as an upper bound.

So in the end, Betterment can't be making more than 52.5 bps on its AUM right now. Assuming that its account-size-distribution and pricing stay the same in the future, we're still in a world where Betterment would need at least $19b in AUM.
