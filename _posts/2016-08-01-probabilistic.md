title: "Probabilistic Business Models"
---

Some coding bootcamps have, basically, the following business model: If you, the student, successfully get a job after the bootcamp, you pay $15k. If you don't get a job, you don't pay anything.

On one hand, this sounds like a straightforwardly good deal; it's a money-back guarantee in which you don't even need to return the product. The student either: 

1. Gets a programming job, worth $150k/year, for just $15k, or
2. Gets a free bootcamp education.

On the other hand, you could view this business model as probabilistic arbitrage. The key is that students have to **apply** to the bootcamp to get in, and the acceptance rates are low. 

It's easiest to see this if you imagine the most evil version possible. Let's say that I'm very good at predicting who will get a job, right now, if they go interview at 10 tech companies over the next four weeks. I'm so good that my precision is 99%; if I think you're going to get a job, you have a 99% chance of actually getting a job. Endowed with this skill, I could make money off a "bootcamp" that provided zero training or assistance. Step 1, admit 100 people who I think will get hired and convice half of them to attend my bootcamp. Step 2, give a placebo of zero-value bootcamp training which in no way helps their job prospects. Step 3, send the students out to job interviews; on average 49 will get an offer. Step 4, Walk my $735k to the bank. By the way, I will be able to advertise honestly that my bootcamp has a 99% placement rate.

To be clear, I'm not saying that bootcamps are useless; I've bumped into several, have seen the "before" and "after" results, and as a result believe that lots of bootcamps provide a **ton** of value to students. Many people come out much more hirable than they were when they went in. However, I think it's interesting that under extreme conditions (as in the paragraph above) the bootcamp model doensn't necessarily **need** to provide this value in order to make money. 

To really measure the value of a bootcamp, you'd need to run a controlled experiment in which half of applicants get the real bootcamp training and half get a "placebo" bootcamp. The value of the bootcamp is the delta between the hiring outcomes of the real bootcamp and the placebo one. Such an experiment will probably never be run.

As an ending note, this argument isn't limited to coding bootcamps. A while ago, there [was a study](http://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/the-college-solution/2011/03/01/the-ivy-league-earnings-myth) on Ivy Leage admissions which found that the starting salaries of Ivy Leage graduates was not significantly different from the starting salaries of students who were admitted to Ivy League schools but chose not to attend.
