title: "Probabilistic Business Models"

Some coding bootcamps have, basically, the following business model: If you, the student, successfully get a job after the bootcamp, you pay $15k. If you don't get a job, you don't pay anything.

On one hand, this sounds like a straightforwardly good deal; it's a money-back guarantee in which you don't even need to return the product. The student either: 

1. Gets a programming job, worth $150k/year, for just $15k, or
2. Gets a free bootcamp education.

On the other hand, you could view this business model as probabilistic arbitrage. The key is that students have to **apply** to the bootcamp to get in, and the acceptance rates are low. 

It's easiest to see this if you imagine the most evil version possible. Let's say that I'm very good at predicting who will get a job, right now, if they go interview at 10 tech companies over the next four weeks. I'm so good that my precision is 99%; if I think you're going to get a job, you have a 99% chance of actually getting a job. Endowed with this skill, I could make money off a "bootcamp" that provided zero training or assistance. Step 1, admit 100 people who I think will get hired and convice half of them to attend my bootcamp. Step 2, give a placebo of zero-value bootcamp training which in no way helps their job prospects. Step 3, send the students out to job interviews; on average 49 will get an offer. Step 4, Walk my $735k to the bank.

To be clear, I'm not saying that bootcamps are useless; I've been inside several, have seen the "before" and "after" results, and as a result believe that lots of bootcamps provide a **ton** of value to students. Many people come out much more hirable than they were when they went in. However, I think it's interesting that under extreme conditions (as in the paragraph above) the bootcamp model doensn't actually **need** to provide this value in order to make money.

Part of the psychology of this is due to risk mispricing and risk aversion. On the former, the student doesn't know how likely they are to get a job (they've only interviewed a few times in their lives) but the hypothetically-evil bootcamp does (they see tons of job candidates and interview results). On the latter, the student doesn't want to miss a $150k/year job for lack of paying a measly $15k; he/she prefers an `r + d` chance of $135k over a `r` chance of $150k, where `r` is the chance of getting the job without the bootcamp and `d` is the incremental chance of getting the job that the bootcamp provides (even if `d
