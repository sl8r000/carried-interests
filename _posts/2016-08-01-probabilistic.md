title: "Probabilistic Business Models"

Some coding bootcamps have, basically, the following business model: You, the student, attends the bootcamp. If you get hired afterwards, then you pay the bootcamp $15k. If you don't get a job (within some reasonable timeframe), then you don't have to pay the bootcamp anything.

On one hand, this sounds like a straightforwardly good deal; it's a money-back guarantee in which you don't even need to return the product. The student either gets a programming job, or a free bootcamp education.

On the other hand, you could view this business model as a fascinating exercise in probabilistic arbitrage. The key is that students have to **apply** to the bootcamp to get in, and the acceptance rates are low. This gives the bootcamp an opportunity to admit students who would get jobs without the bootcamp's help.

It's easiest to see this if you imagine the most evil version possible. Let's say that I have a bootcamp that provides 0 value to students; they don't get any better at coding, and their chances of passing a job interview remain the same. But I'm very good at figuring out which students could get jobs without my bootcamp, which students would be able to get a job today if they just started interviewing. My process is so good that it has 95% precision; i
